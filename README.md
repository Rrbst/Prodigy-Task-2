Overview of the Project

PROJECT : Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

Objective
The goal of this project is to perform comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. This involves preparing the data for analysis by addressing missing values, handling outliers, and transforming variables. EDA will uncover relationships, trends, and patterns among variables to gain insights into the factors influencing survival during the Titanic disaster.

Dataset: Titanic Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Features:
Passenger demographics (age, gender, class, etc.)
Travel details (ticket class, fare, cabin, embarkation point)
Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Steps Involved
Data Collection:

Load the Titanic dataset from Kaggle or other sources.
Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values (e.g., fill missing ages with median values or use interpolation).
Correct inconsistent or duplicate data entries.
Transform categorical variables into appropriate formats (e.g., encoding).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate Analysis:
Analyze individual variables, such as the distribution of age, gender, and fare.
Bivariate Analysis:
Explore relationships between two variables, such as gender and survival or class and survival.
Use visualizations like boxplots, bar charts, and scatter plots.
Multivariate Analysis:
Examine interactions between multiple variables, such as gender, class, and survival.
Use heatmaps to show correlations among numeric features.
Key Insights:

Identify patterns influencing survival (e.g., women and children had higher survival rates).
Analyze socio-economic factors such as class and fare impact.
Investigate ticket embarkation points and their correlation with survival rates.
Tools and Libraries
Python: For programming.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For preprocessing if needed.
Deliverables
Data Cleaning Report: Summary of steps taken to clean the data.
EDA Report: A detailed analysis of variable distributions and relationships.
Visualizations: Graphs and charts illustrating insights (e.g., survival by gender or class).
Summary of Findings: Key insights and patterns uncovered in the analysis.
Applications
This project is a stepping stone for predictive modeling, such as building a machine learning model to predict survival.
The findings provide insights into human behavior and decision-making in crisis scenarios.
